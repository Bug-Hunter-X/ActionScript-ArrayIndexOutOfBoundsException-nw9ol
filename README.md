# ActionScript ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

This repository demonstrates a common error in ActionScript 3: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  This exception occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array.  Valid indices are from 0 to array.length - 1.

The `bug.as` file contains code that throws this exception. The `bugSolution.as` file demonstrates how to fix it.
